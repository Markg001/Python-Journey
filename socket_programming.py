# Summary of Socket Programming in Python
# Introduction to Socket Programming

#     The socket module allows creating TCP and UDP clients and servers for network applications.
#     Sockets enable communication between processes on the same or different machines.
#     A socket address consists of an IP address and a port number.

# Types of Sockets

#     TCP Sockets (socket.SOCK_STREAM): Connection-oriented and reliable.
#     UDP Sockets (socket.SOCK_DGRAM): Connectionless and faster, but less reliable.

# Categoties of Sockets

#     UNIX Sockets (socket.AF_UNIX): Used for local inter-process communication.
#     IPv4 (socket.AF_INET) 
#     IPv6 (socket.AF_INET6): Used for network communication.
#     Raw Sockets: Allow direct access to network and transport layer protocols.

# Key Socket Functions

#     socket.socket(socket_family, socket_type): Creates a socket.
#     socket.bind(address): Binds a socket to an IP and port.
#     socket.listen(count): Listens for incoming connections.
#     socket.accept(): Accepts a client connection.
#     socket.connect(ip_address): Connects a client to a server.
#     socket.send(data): Sends data through the socket.
#     socket.recv(buflen): Receives data from a socket.
#     socket.close(): Closes the socket and releases resources.

# Server and Client Socket Methods
# Server-Side:

#     bind(address): Assigns an address to a socket.
#     listen(count): Starts listening for incoming connections.
#     accept(): Accepts client connections.

# Client-Side:

#     connect(ip_address): Connects to a server.
#     connect_ext(ip_address): Connects with error handling.

# Additional Information

#     Pythonâ€™s socket module includes built-in methods for IP resolution, hostname retrieval, and network communication.
#     The module comes pre-installed with Python and can be imported using import socket.
#     Network tools like Scapy can manipulate and analyze network packets.
